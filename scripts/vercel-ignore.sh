# Vercel "Ignored Build Step" gate.
#
# Convention Vercel follows: exit 1 = BUILD, exit 0 = SKIP.
#
#   - Production deploy (push to the production branch / a merge) -> always BUILD
#   - Commit with no associated pull request                      -> SKIP
#   - PR that does NOT have the "deploy-preview" label            -> SKIP
#   - PR that HAS the "deploy-preview" label                      -> BUILD a preview
#
# Point the Vercel project's Ignored Build Step at:  bash scripts/vercel-ignore.sh
#
# The label lookup uses the public GitHub API (these repos are public). If a
# GITHUB_TOKEN env var is set on the Vercel project it is used automatically to
# raise the API rate limit; it is not required.
